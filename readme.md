This is a tool for you to analyze what happened to the members in a Facebook group.

## Semi-automated part

If you scraped the member list from a Facebook group by copying and pasting manually, you would definitely need the semi-automated part.

We first made lists of names and save them to .csv files, then compared the difference between the names inside two .csv files. After that you may analyze what people are doing by running our crawler (not yet posted to Github; please wait.)


Edit: we have a crawler now, but it can only login to Facebook and go to the private groups right now. Still have to work on it :))

## To-do

 - Searching for members and their contents within the group via the crawler
